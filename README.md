# Berkeley_Hackathon

Paul is your charming personal lawyer who already knows all the laws and helps you battle your legal cases.

Trained over a handful of law documents on which we could get our hands on, we trained a chatbot
using GPT-4 LLM who can accurately answer your law queries.

The inspiration for this project was simple - approaching lawyers can be expensive and intimidating,
and a space where AI can step in to provide help. So we built Paul who can provide reliable advice on 
information it is trained on.

This submission is with respect to the University of California Berkeley AI Hackathon 2023.
